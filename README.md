# riscv-fpga

## About this work
A toy implementation of the customized RISC-V core that supports for [xv6](https://github.com/kura197/xv6-riscv) OS.   
Because of the limited on-chip memory on my FPGA board, I implemented controllers for SD card to save the OS image, and for SDRAM as a main memory.  
This work was exhibited at Maker Faire Tokyo 2018.
